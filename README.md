# Recreating SynthID: Watermarking AI-generated Content (Images and Text)

## Inspiration

AI has been accelerating the spread of misinformation and disinformation online, and itâ€™s been harder to tell AI-generated and human-generated text apart. Roughly 57% of AI-generated content on the internet is most likely AI-generated. At the same time, tons of photorealistic AI-generated images have been fooling the internet despite algorithms designed to demote and remove AI-generated content.

Recently, Google unveiled SynthID: an algorithm that inserts digital watermarks in AI-generated content, including images, videos, text, and audio. These watermarks can be used to track AI-generated content circulating the internet. For my second replicate at The Knowledge Society, I recreated SynthID's function for images and text. Feel free to use this code in any AI-watermarking projects as long as you follow the Apache 2.0 license.

## Currently this repository consists of code for:
* An image watermarking system (Jupyter Notebook Python file)
* A text watermarking system (coming soon)
